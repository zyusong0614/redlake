Python,Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Python: A Practical Guide,"Hey everyone

I just made a nice video about concurrent and parallel in python using threads and processes.



it shows you the differences along with some real word use cases for both, and it also shows how to 

safely pass data between threads by using mutexes.



we first start by creating a program which doesn't use concurrent or parallel techniques (threads or processes)

but then we write the same program with those techniques and see the performance differences.

Python,I built a Go-like channel package for Python asyncio,"[Repositoy here ](https://github.com/Gwali-1/PY_CHANNELS_ASYNC)

Docs here  =&gt; https://gwali-1.github.io/PY_CHANNELS_ASYNC/

Roughly a month ago, I was looking into concurrency as a topic, specifically async-await implementation internals in C# trying to understand the various components Involved, like the event loop, scheduling etc.

After sometime I understood enough to want to implement a channel data structure in Python so I built one. 

**What My Project Does.**

Pychanasync provides a channel-based message passing abstraction for asyncio coroutines. With it, you can 

Create buffered and unbuffered channels 
Send and receive values between coroutines synchronously and asynchronously 
Use channels as async iterators 
Use a select-like utility to wait on multiple channel operations.

It enables seamless and synchronized coroutune communication using structured message passing instead of relying shared state and locks. 


**Target Audience**

 Pychanasync is for developers working with asyncio.

If you're doing asynchronous programming in Python or exploring asycio and want a provide some
structure and synchronization to your program I highly recommend. 

**Comparison**

Pychanasync is heavily inspired by Go’s native channel primitive. It follows its the behaviour semantics and design.

Python,Process Memory manipulator in Python. (Windows x64),"I made a useful tool for interacting with process memory based on ctypes and Windows API. It’s for Windows x64. 

**What My Project Does**:

Helps you interacting with a process.

1) Writes / Reads bytes to/from a process virtual memory.

2) Writes / Reads int32 to/from a process virtual memory.

3) Writes / Reads int64 to/from a process virtual memory.

4) Injects dll (Windows API).

5) Ejects dll.

6) Finds pattern / sequence of bytes in memory.

7) Gets the final address of the multi-level pointer by a list of offsets.

8) Checks if the dll is in a module list of a process. 

9) Gets modules (dlls) list. 

10) Allocates memory.

It is also highly recommended to use it with “with Process() as” block, so it safer. If not, you should clear all allocations via allocate() method with free_allocates().

**Target Audience**:

Researchers and developers interested in Windows programming. 

**Comparison**:

PyMem and other modules like pywin32 always lack functions that are provided here. The code is also very safe in terms of closing handles. Which is very important.

Python,Heap/Priority Queue that supports removing arbitrary items and frequency tracking,"I created a Python heap implementation that supports:
- Removing any item (not just the root via pop)
- Tracking the frequency of items so that duplicates are handled efficiently

**Source**: [https://github.com/Ite-O/python-indexed-heap](https://github.com/Ite-O/python-indexed-heap)  
**PyPI**: [https://pypi.org/project/indexedheap/](https://pypi.org/project/indexedheap/)

## What My Project Does
`indexedheap` is a Python package that provides standard heap operations, insert (push), pop, and peek, along with additional features:

- Remove any arbitrary item efficiently.
- Track frequencies of items to handle duplicates.
- Insert or remove multiple occurrences in a single operation.
- Iterate over heap contents in sorted order without modifying the heap.

It is designed for scenarios requiring dynamic priority queues, where an item’s priority may change over time Common in task schedulers, caching systems or pathfinding algorithms.

## Target Audience
- Developers needing dynamic priority queues where priorities can increase or decrease.
- Users who want duplicate-aware heaps for frequency tracking.
- Engineers implementing task schedulers, caches, simulations or pathfinding algorithms in Python.

## Comparison
### Python’s built-in `heapq` vs `indexedheap`

| Operation | Description | `heapq` | `indexedheap` |
|------------|--------------|---------|----------------|
| `heappush(heap, item)` / `insert(item)` | Add an item to the heap | ✅ `O(log N)` | ✅ `O(log N)` / *(`O(1)` if item already exists and count is incremented)* |
| `heappop(heap)` / `pop()`| Remove and return the root item | ✅ `O(log N)` | ✅ `O(log N)` |
| `heap[0]` / `peek()` | Return root item without removing it | ✅ Manual (`heap[0]`) | ✅ `O(1)` |
| `remove(item)` | Remove any arbitrary item | ❌ Not supported | ✅ `O(log(N))` for last occurence in heap, `O(1)` if only decrementing frequency |
| `heappushpop(heap, item)` | Push then pop in a single operation | ✅ `O(log N)` | ❌ Not directly supported *(use `insert()` + `pop()`)* |
| `heapreplace(heap, item)` | Pop then push in a single operation | ✅ `O(log N)` | ❌ Not directly supported *(use `pop()` + `insert()`)* |
| `count(item)` | Get frequency of a specific item | ❌ Not supported | ✅ `O(1)` |
| `item in heap` | Membership check | ⚠️ `O(N)` (linear scan) |✅ `O(1)` |
| `len(heap)` | Number of elements | ✅ `O(1)` | ✅ `O(1)` |
| `to_sorted_list()` | Return sorted elements without modifying heap | ✅ Requires creating a sorted copy of the heap `O(N log N)` | ✅ `O(N log N)` |
| `iter(heap)` | Iterate in sorted order | ✅ Requires creating a sorted copy of the heap and iterating over the copy `O(N log N)`) | ✅ `O(N log N)` |
| `heapify(list)` / `MinHeap(list), MaxHeap(list)` | Convert list to valid heap | ✅ `O(N)` | ✅ `O(N)` |
| `heap1 == heap2` | Structural equality check | ✅ `O(N)` |  ✅ `O(N)` |
| `Frequency tracking` | Track frequency of items rather than store duplicates | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Yes |
| `Multi-inserts/removals` | Insert/ remove multiples of an item in a single operation |❌ Not supported | ✅ Yes (see insert/ remove rows for time complexity) |

 ## Installation

```bash
pip install indexedheap
```

## Feedback
If there is demand, I am considering adding support for `heappushpop` and `heapreplace` operations, similar to those in Python's `heapq` module.

Open to any feedback!

Python,T-Strings: Python's Fifth String Formatting Technique?,"Every time I've talked about Python 3.14's new t-strings online, many folks have been confused about how t-strings are different from f-strings, why t-strings are useful, and whether t-strings are a replacement for f-strings.

  
I published [a short article (and video) on Python 3.14's new t-strings](https://pym.dev/t-strings-in-python/) that's meant to explain this.

The TL;DR:

* Python has had 4 string formatting approaches before t-strings
* T-strings are different because they *don't actually return strings*
* T-strings are useful for library authors who need the disassembled parts of a string interpolation for the purpose of pre-processing interpolations
* T-strings definitely do not replace f-strings: keep using f-strings until specific libraries tell you to use a t-string with one or more of their utilities

Watch the video or read the article for a short demo and a library that uses them as well.

If you've been confusing about t-strings, I hope this explanation helps.",0.91,202,0,202

Python,You need some advanced decorator patterns,"Most developers know the basics of decorators — like `staticmethod` or `lru_cache`.  
But once you go beyond these, decorators can become *powerful building blocks* for clean, reusable, and elegant code.

In my latest [blog](https://medium.com/techtofreedom/10-advanced-python-decorator-patterns-for-clean-and-efficient-code-6d4ac670b26e?sk=23d2e31c38c382808b37753460e1371b), I explored **10 advanced decorator patterns** that go beyond the usual tutorials.

Here’s a quick summary of what’s inside:

# 1️⃣ TTL-Based Caching

Forget `lru_cache` that keeps results forever.  
A **time-to-live cache** decorator lets your cache entries expire after a set duration — perfect for APIs and temporary data.

# 2️⃣ Retry on Failure

Wrap any unstable I/O call (like a flaky API) and let the decorator handle retries with delay logic automatically.

# 3️⃣ Execution Time Tracker

Measure function performance in milliseconds without modifying your core logic.

# 4️⃣ Role-Based Access Control

Add lightweight user permission checks (`@require_role(""admin"")`) without touching your business code.

# 5️⃣ Simple Logging Decorator

A minimal yet powerful pattern to track every call and return value — no need for heavy logging frameworks.

# 6️⃣ Dependency Injection Decorator

Inject services (like `logger` or `validator`) into your functions globally — no need for long argument lists.

# 7️⃣ Class-Wide Decorator

Decorate *all* methods of a class in one shot. Useful for timing, logging, or enforcing constraints project-wide.

# 8️⃣ Singleton Factory

Implement the singleton pattern with a one-liner decorator — ideal for configurations or resource-heavy classes.

# 9️⃣ Rate Limiter

Throttle function calls to avoid API abuse or user spamming — essential for stable production systems.

# 🔟 Context Management Decorator

Propagate request IDs, user contexts, or session data automatically across threads and async tasks.

Python,Python Pest - A port of Rust's pest,"I recently released Python Pest, a port of the Rust pest parsing library.

# What My Project Does

Python Pest is a declarative PEG parser generator for Python, ported from Rust's Pest. You write grammars instead of hand-coding parsing logic, and it builds parse trees automatically.

Define a grammar using Pest version 2 syntax, like this:

    jsonpath        = _{ SOI ~ jsonpath_query ~ EOI }
    jsonpath_query  = _{ root_identifier ~ segments }
    segments        = _{ (S ~ segment)* }
    root_identifier = _{ ""$"" }
    
    segment = _{
      | child_segment
      | descendant_segment
    }
    
    // snip

And traverse parse trees using [structural pattern matching](https://peps.python.org/pep-0636/), like this:

    def parse_segment(self, segment: Pair) -&gt; Segment:
        match segment:
            case Pair(Rule.CHILD_SEGMENT, [inner]):
                return ChildSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner))
            case Pair(Rule.DESCENDANT_SEGMENT, [inner]):
                return RecursiveDescentSegment(segment, self.parse_segment_inner(inner))
            case Pair(Rule.NAME_SEGMENT, [inner]) | Pair(Rule.INDEX_SEGMENT, [inner]):
                return ChildSegment(segment, [self.parse_selector(inner)])
            case _:
                raise JSONPathSyntaxError(""expected a segment"", segment)

See [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-pest/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-pest) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/python-pest/) for a complete example.

# Target Audience

* Python developers who need to parse custom languages, data formats, or DSLs.
* Anyone interested in grammar-first design over hand-coded parsers.
* Developers curious about leveraging Python's match/case for tree-walking.

# Comparison

Parsimonious is another general purpose, pure Python parser package that reads parsing expression grammars. Python Pest differs in grammar syntax and subsequent tree traversal technique, preferring external iteration of parse trees instead of defining a visitor.

# Feedback

I'd appreciate any feedback, especially your thoughts on the trade-off between declarative grammars and performance in Python. Does the clarity and maintainability make up for slower execution compared to hand-tuned parsers?

Python,New UV Gitlab Component,"I tried today to recreate a GitHub action which provides a python \`uv setup as a GitLab CI component.

# What this Component achieves

While the documentation of UV already explains how to implement `uv` inside of GitLab CI, it still fills the `.gitlab-ci.yml` quite a bit.

My Component tries to minimize that, by also providing a lot of customizations.

# Examples

The following example demonstrates how to implement the component on gitlab.com:

    include:
      - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/gitlab-uv-templates/python-uv-component/python-uv@1.0.0
    
    single-test:
      extends: .python-uv-setup
      stage: test
      script:
        - uv run python -c ""print('Hello UV!')""

The next examples demonstrate how to achieve parallel matrix execution:

    include:
      - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/gitlab-uv-templates/python-uv-component/python-uv@1.0.0
        inputs:
          python_version: $PYTHON_V
          uv_version: 0.9.4
          base_layer: bookworm-slim
    
    matrix-test:
      extends: .python-uv-setup
      stage: test
      parallel:
        matrix:
          - PYTHON_V: [""3.12"", ""3.11"", ""3.10""]
      script:
        - uv run python --version""
      variables:
        PYTHON_V: $PYTHON_V

Python,I built a Persistent KV Store in Pure Python,"Hi everyone!

 I'm a final year CS student and I've been reading about data storage and storage engines. This is a passion project that I've been working on for the past few months. It is a lightweight, persistent key-value storage engine in Python, built from scratch to understand and implement the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) architecture. The project, which is fully open-source, is explicitly optimized for write-heavy workloads. 



# Core Architecture:

The engine implements the three fundamental LSM components: the **Write Ahead Log (WAL)** for durability, an in-memory **Memtable** (using `SortedDict` for sorted writes), and immutable persistent **SSTables (Sorted String Tables)**.

Some features that I'm proud of:

* **Async Compaction**: Merging and compaction are handled by a **separate background worker thread**. The process itself takes a hybrid approach.
* **Client/Server Model**: The entire storage engine runs behind a **FastAPI server**. This allows multiple clients to connect via REST APIs or the included CLI tool.
* **Efficient Range Queries**: Added full support for range queries from `start_key` to `end_key`. This is achieved via a memory-efficient **k-way merge iterator** that combines results from the Memtable and all SSTables. The FastAPI server delivers the results using a `StreamingResponse` to prevent memory exhaustion for large result sets.
* **Bloom Filter**: Implemented a **Bloom Filter** for each SSTable to drastically reduce disk I/O by confirming that a key definitely does not exist before attempting a disk seek.
* **Binary Storage**: SSTables now use **Msgpack binary format** instead of JSON for smaller file sizes and reduced CPU load during serialization/deserialization.

My favourite part of the project is that I actually got to see a practical implementation of [Merge Sorted Arrays - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/merge-k-sorted-arrays/). This is a pretty popular interview question and to see DSA being actually implemented is a crazy moment.

# Get Started

**Usage via CLI/Server:**

1. **Terminal 1 (Server):** `lsm-server`
2. **Terminal 2 (Client):** `lsm-cli` (Follow the CLI help for commands).

# Looking for Feedback

Python,"NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer: A Python-Powered, Privacy-First System and Network Optimization","I'm excited to share **NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer**, a comprehensive, open-source tool written primarily in **Python** designed to enhance system and network performance for gamers.

While the primary use case is gaming, the core is a set of Python modules for process management, network analysis, and system configuration, making it a great example of Python for low-level system interaction on Windows/Linux.

# What My Project Does

NGXSMK GameNet Optimizer is a utility suite that addresses common performance bottlenecks by providing:

* **Network Optimization:** Uses a Python module to analyze and test latency to various global servers (especially for games like League of Legends) and includes a traffic shaper to prioritize gaming packets (QoS).
* **System Performance:** Manages system resources by setting high process priority for games, cleaning up unnecessary background applications, and optimizing RAM usage in real-time.
* **System-Agnostic Core:** The majority of the logic is contained in cross-platform Python scripts (`main.py`, `modules/`), with platform-specific commands handled by batch/shell scripts (`run.bat`, `run.sh`).

Target Audience

This tool is primarily for **PC Gamers** who are performance-conscious and want a free, transparent alternative to commercial ""game booster"" software.

From a development perspective, the **Target Audience** also includes **Python developers** interested in:

* Python for **system programming** (e.g., process and memory management on Windows/Linux).
* Building **cross-platform utility applications** with a Python backend.

This is meant to be a **production-ready utility** that is robust and reliable for daily use.

# Comparison

Of course the particularities of the project might affect your answer to some degree and I'm aware of that, but for the sake of trying to point me to the right direction let's try to make the best out of this.

I would make some typescript analogies in order for you to better understand what I'm aiming at with the stack.

2.Deployment - vercel/fallback to aws lambda
3.Package manager - pnpm
4.Types - typescript

Python,func-to-web is now much better – Thanks for the feedback!,"15 days ago I shared func-to-web here and got amazing feedback (150+ upvotes, thank you!). Since then, I've been working hard on the suggestions and added some major features.

**What it does (quick reminder):**
Turn any Python function into a web UI with zero boilerplate:

```python
from func_to_web import run

def divide(a: int, b: int):
    return a / b

run(divide)  # Web form at localhost:8000
```

**Major updates since v0.1:**

**Dynamic Lists** – Add/remove items with advanced validation:
```python
def process_data(
    # Dynamic lists with add/remove buttons
    images: list[ImageFile],                      # Multiple file uploads
    
    # Dual validation: list size AND individual items
    scores: Annotated[
        list[Annotated[int, Field(ge=0, le=100)]], 
        Field(min_length=3, max_length=10)
    ],  # 3-10 items required, each 0-100
    
    # Optional fields with toggle switches
    notes: str | None = None,                     # Optional text
    tags: list[str] | None = None                 # Optional list
):
    return FileResponse(generate_pdf(), ""report.pdf"")  # Auto-download
```

**High-Performance File Handling** – Optimized streaming for large files:
- **Upload**: Real-time progress bars, 8MB chunks, handles GB+ files
- **Download**: Return `FileResponse(data, filename)` for auto-downloads
- **Performance**: ~237 MB/s localhost, ~115 MB/s over Gigabit Ethernet
- **Memory efficient**: Constant usage regardless of file size
- **Any format**: PDF, Excel, ZIP, images, binary data

**Optional Fields** – `Type | None` creates toggle switches:
- Fields with defaults start enabled, without defaults start disabled
- Explicit control: `Type | OptionalEnabled/OptionalDisabled`
- Works with all types, constraints, and lists

**Dynamic Dropdowns** – Runtime-generated options:
```python
def get_themes(): return fetch_from_database()

def configure(theme: Literal[get_themes]): pass  # Fresh options each request
```

**Rich Output Support**:
- **PIL Images**: Auto-displayed in browser
- **Matplotlib plots**: Rendered as PNG
- **File downloads**: Single or multiple files with streaming
- **JSON/text**: Formatted with copy-to-clipboard

**UX Improvements**:
- Dark mode with theme persistence
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter to submit)
- Auto-focus first field
- Toast notifications
- Upload progress with speed indicators

**Current stats:**
- 180+ GitHub stars (The chinese community is sharing it too!)
- 454 unit tests
- Published on PyPI: `pip install func-to-web`
- 20+ runnable examples
- Used daily for internal tools at multiple companies

**Other improvements:**
- **Modular architecture**: Code separated by responsibilities (analysis, validation, form building...)
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every function and class documented
- **Detailed changelog**: Track all improvements and breaking changes

I've tried to make this as professional and production-ready as possible while keeping the simple API.

Still focused on internal tools and rapid prototyping, not replacing proper web frameworks.

The community feedback really shaped these improvements. Thank you again! Keep the suggestions coming.",0.85,21,0,21
Python,I built a tool that tells you how hard a website is to scrape,"# UPDATE:

Website is now live!

Try it now: [https://www.caniscrape.org](https://www.caniscrape.org/)

\- No installation required

\- Instant analysis

\- Same comprehensive checks as the CLI

NOTE:  
I haven't added the flag capabilities yet so its just the default scan. Its also still one link at a time, so all the great ideas I've received for the website will come soon (I'm gonna keep working on it). It'll take about 1-3 days but ill make it a lot better for the V1.0.0 release.

CLI still available on GitHub for those who prefer it.



Hi everyone,  
I made a Python package called **caniscrape** that analyzes any website's anti-bot protections before you start scraping.

It tells you what you're up against (Cloudflare, rate limits, JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, TLS fingerprinting, honeypots) and gives you a difficulty score + specific recommendations.

# What My Project Does

caniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:

* A difficulty score (0–10)
* Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)
* What tools you’ll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)
* Whether using a scraping API might be better

This helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.

# Target Audience

* Web scrapers, data engineers, and researchers who deal with protected or dynamic websites
* Developers who want to test bot-detection systems or analyze site defenses
* Hobbyists learning about anti-bot tech and detection methods

It’s not a bypassing or cracking tool — it’s for diagnostics and awareness.

# Comparison

Unlike tools like WAFW00F or WhatWaf, which only detect web application firewalls,  
caniscrape runs multi-layered tests:

* Simulates browser and bot requests (via Playwright)
* Detects rate limits, JavaScript challenges, and honeypot traps
* Scores site difficulty based on detection layers
* Suggests scraping strategies or alternative services

So it’s more of a pre-scrape analysis toolkit, not just a WAF detector.

# Installation

    pip install caniscrape

Quick setup (required):

    playwright install chromium  # Download browser
    pipx install wafw00f         # WAF detection

# Example Usage

    caniscrape https://example.com

Output includes:

* Difficulty score (0–10)
* Active protections
* Recommended tools/approach

# ADVICE:

Results can vary between runs because bot protections adapt dynamically.  
Some heavy-protection sites (like Amazon) may produce these varied results. Of course, this will improve over time, but running the command multiple times can mitigate this.

Python,Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler (Python) — updated — testers &amp; contributors wanted," I updated a small Python compiler that converts an assembly-like language into Minecraft command-block command sequences. Looking for testers, feedback, and contributors. Repo: [https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler](https://github.com/Bowser04/Assembly-to-Minecraft-Command-Block-Compiler)

What My Project Does:

* Parses a tiny assembly-style language (labels, arithmetic, branches, simple I/O) and emits Minecraft command sequences tailored for command blocks.
* Produces low-level, inspectable output so you can see how program logic maps to in-game command-block logic.
* Implemented in Python for readability and easy contribution.

Target Audience:

* Minecraft command-block creators who want to run low-level programs without mods.
* Hobbyist compiler writers and learners looking for a compact Python codegen example.
* Contributors interested in parsing, code generation, testing strategies, or command optimization.
* This is an educational/hobby tool for small demos and experiments — not a production compiler for large-scale programs.

Comparison (how it differs from alternatives):

* Assembly-focused: unlike high-level language→Minecraft tools, it targets an assembly-like input so outputs are low-level and easy to debug in command blocks.
* Python-first and lightweight: prioritizes clarity and contributor-friendliness over performance.
* Command-block oriented: designed to work with vanilla in-game command blocks (does not target datapacks or mods).

How to help:

* Test: run examples, try outputs in a world, and note Minecraft version and exact steps when something fails.
* Report: open issues with minimal reproduction files and steps.
* Contribute: PRs welcome for bug fixes, examples, optimizations, docs, or tests — look for good-first-issue.",0.72,6,0,6
Python,Access computed Excel values made easy using calc-workbook library,"`calc-workbook` is an easy-to-use Python library that lets you access *computed Excel values* directly from Python. It loads Excel files, evaluates all formulas using the `formulas` engine, and provides a clean, minimal API to read the computed results from each sheet — no Excel installation required.

# What My Project Does

This project solves a common frustration when working with Excel files in Python: most libraries can read or write workbooks, but they can’t compute formulas. `calc-workbook` bridges that gap. You load an Excel file, it computes all the formulas using the `formulas` package, and you can instantly access the computed cell values — just like Excel would show them. Everything runs natively in Python, making it platform-independent and ideal for Linux users who want full Excel compatibility without Excel itself.

# Target Audience

For Python developers, data analysts, or automation engineers who work with Excel files and want to access real formula results (not just static values) without relying on Excel or heavy dependencies.

# Comparison

* **openpyxl** and **pandas** can read and write Excel files but do not calculate formulas.
* **xlwings** requires Excel to compute formulas and is Windows/macOS only.
* **calc-workbook** computes formulas natively in Python using the `formulas` engine and gives you the results in one simple call.

# Installation

    pip install calc-workbook

# Example

    from calc_workbook import CalcWorkbook
    
    wb = CalcWorkbook.load(""example.xlsx"")
    print(wb.get_sheet_names())           # ['sheet1']
    
    sheet = wb.get_sheet(""sheet1"")        # or get_sheet() to get the first sheet
    print(""A1:"", sheet.cell(""A1""))        # 10
    print(""A2:"", sheet.cell(""A2""))        # 20
    print(""A3:"", sheet.cell(""A3""))        # 200

# Example Excel file:

|**A**|**B**|
|:-|:-|
|**1**|10|
|**2**|20|
|**3**|`=A1+A2`|
