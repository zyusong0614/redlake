It uses the API to create images, generate variations of said images, and you can take a pic with your phone and use the “edit” feature to do stuff like putting a Pokémon in one of your pictures. Then it saves everything to an AWS bucket.\\n\\nYou can check it out here: [image generator and gallery](https://luis-aws.streamlit.app). I have a placeholder API key on it right now because I wasn’t using it very much. You can message me for my contact info.\\n\\nBelow is a real pic with a dragon added with API on the middle right. I imagine dalle 3 would be able to produce higher quality images, even better than photoshop’s AI since the images are not “ethically sourced”.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajl0bclhrzrb1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28508c55f0143a616a0de126a6e34a8421f5c94b\\n\\nEdit: fixed typos',\n",

It uses the API to create images, generate variations of said images, and you can take a pic with your phone and use the “edit” feature to do stuff like putting a Pokémon in one of your pictures. Then it saves everything to an AWS bucket.\\n\\nYou can check it out here: [image generator and gallery](https://luis-aws.streamlit.app). I have a placeholder API key on it right now because I wasn’t using it very much. You can message me for my contact info.\\n\\nBelow is a real pic with a dragon added with API on the middle right. I imagine dalle 3 would be able to produce higher quality images, even better than photoshop’s AI since the images are not “ethically sourced”.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajl0bclhrzrb1.jpeg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28508c55f0143a616a0de126a6e34a8421f5c94b\\n\\nEdit: fixed typos',\n",
